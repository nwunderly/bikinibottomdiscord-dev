# Story

The story of the factions was revealed on 11/03/2020 as a sneak peak to Jellymon. The announcement post can be found [here.](https://discord.com/channels/384811165949231104/476854142846107668/773275297289994250)

_"Do you feel it? The fields is shrouded... in tension... Close your eyes... What do you see? Who is the enemy?_

_Royal purists? Snipers? Commies?_

_When King Neptune discovered Jellyfish Fields, he sought to protect it. To preserve it. To enable Royalty to have fun. But through good heart, leaves a gap for some to have different intentions. Shrouded in darkness, Droid and his Union came to light. His following gaining and strengthening over the past two years. Droid followers hoarded their jellies to the leader, not allowing others to enjoy the Fields._

_Through punishments and changes, King Neptune tried to ban Droid and his followers from the Fields, ensuring his domain be what he intended. But the problem was bigger than Neptune thought. The Droid followers were more rooted and devoted than he had originally thought. Union members rioted, protested, and eventually got Neptune to back down and reverse the decision._

_But this was not the end of the division within the fields. There was another. Underground, covert, backstreet tacticians known privately as the Sniper's Guild roamed the fields, explicitly to subvert Droid and his followers and wreak havoc to the Royals. All the jellies - all for themselves, and no one else._

_It was when Droid got his way that the leader felt it was his time to step up and claim leadership for his portion of the fields for his followers... who was it? King Mafia Boss. Yes! Indeed! King Mafia Boss, once hunted by the Union and Royalty, finally reveals himself as the mastermind behind the Guild. Sniping is the name, chaos is the game._

_Seeing the Fields break off into three Factions, the Royalty, the Union, and the Guild, King Neptune is prepared to hold the following referendum: Which jellyfish group shall control the fields? A decision will begin to be made sometime next week. Stay tuned!"_ (dovedevic 11/03/2020)

The second part of the story was revealed on 11/10/2020 and is a continuation from the first part. The announcement post can be found [here.](https://discord.com/channels/384811165949231104/476854142846107668/775873068173885460)

_"King Neptune was right, the fields were divided. And while the three factions fought about who will take control of the fields, no one seemed to pay attention to the things that mattered most to them all... the jellyfish._

_Watching the catchers bicker and fight over them, the Jellyfish had made their own opinions, and many disagreed. It almost seems as if the jellyfish wanted to be in certain factions... they too wanted to fight each other... and to grow stronger, and to help their catchers, and to... let them... catchem all..."_ (dovedevic 11/10/2020)

# Clubs

On top of the three factions, there are 5 clubs:
* One for each faction
* One for mods
* And one special restricted club

By being top rank in your faction (you can use !license or !l to see your rank), you will grain the title of **Club Master**! Being a Club Master comes with perks: increased XP, rewards, and of course valor. Defeating a Club Master in normal or ranked battle will also reward you with bonus XP.
