This jelly spawns with a "buzz buzz" message. If stung upon swinging, the jellyfisher will not be able to sting for 30 seconds because their "hand is cramping".

### Notes:
The most basic of all jellyfish the pink is a good beginners target. Though it may only be one point if you catch enough they really start to stack.
